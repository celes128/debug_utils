# debug_utils

This is a library with debug utilities.
The library contains for now only a ConsoleHistory class.

# ConsoleHistory class

The purpose of this class is to emulate an history for a console or terminal:
when pressing the up key you get a later entry from the history and
when pressing the down key you get a more recent entry.
There is a (non-interactive) console application that shows how to use this class.
